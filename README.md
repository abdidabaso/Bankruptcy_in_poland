# Bankruptcy in poland
In this project, I'll be looking at corporate bankruptcies in Poland. To do that, I'll need to get data that's been stored in a JSON file, explore it, and turn it into a DataFrame that we'll use to train our model.

The concept covered in this projects are;
* Compressing and Decompressing Files
* Reading a JSON file into a DataFrame using pandas
* Context managers
* Load a JSON file into a dictionary using python
